                <p>Exercise is physical activity that enhances or maintains fitness and overall health.[1][2] It is performed for various reasons, including weight loss or maintenance, to aid growth and improve strength, develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills, improve health,[3] or simply for enjoyment. Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.

                    In terms of health benefits, usually, 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity exercise per week is recommended for reducing the risk of health problems.[6][7][8] At the same time, even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none. Only doing an hour and a quarter (11 minutes/day) of exercise could reduce the risk of early death, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer.</p>
            
                    <p>Physical exercises are generally grouped into three types, depending on the overall effect they have on the human body:[11]

                        Aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen than it would while resting.[11] The goal of aerobic exercise is to increase cardiovascular endurance.[12] Examples of aerobic exercise include running, cycling, swimming, brisk walking, skipping rope, rowing, hiking, dancing, playing tennis, continuous training, and long distance running.[11]
                        Anaerobic exercise, which includes strength and resistance training, can firm, strengthen, and increase muscle mass, as well as improve bone density, balance, and coordination.[11] Examples of strength exercises are push-ups, pull-ups, lunges, squats, bench press. Anaerobic exercise also includes weight training, functional training, Eccentric Training, interval training, sprinting, and high-intensity interval training which increase short-term muscle strength.[11][13]
                        Flexibility exercises stretch and lengthen muscles.[11] Activities such as stretching help to improve joint flexibility and keep muscles limber.[11] The goal is to improve the range of motion which can reduce the chance of injury.[11][14]
                        Physical exercise can also include training that focuses on accuracy, agility, power, and speed.[15]
                        
                        Types of exercise can also be classified as dynamic or static. 'Dynamic' exercises such as steady running, tend to produce a lowering of the diastolic blood pressure during exercise, due to the improved blood flow. Conversely, static exercise (such as weight-lifting) can cause the systolic pressure to rise significantly, albeit transiently, during the performance of the exercise.</p>
